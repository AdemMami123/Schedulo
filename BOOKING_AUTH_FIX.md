# Booking Authentication and Authorization Fix

## Issue Description
When User A books a meeting with User B's calendar, User A (the requester) was incorrectly seeing the confirm/decline buttons instead of User B (the calendar owner).

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was in the user ID consistency between booking creation and booking retrieval:

1. **BookingForm**: When creating a booking, `userId` is set to `user.id` (the calendar owner's ID)
2. **BookingHistory**: When querying bookings, it was using `userProfile.id` for host bookings
3. **Potential mismatch**: `user.id` vs `userProfile.id` could be different in some cases

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Consistent User ID Usage
- **BookingForm**: Uses `user.id` for `userId` field (calendar owner)
- **BookingHistory**: Now uses `user.uid` for host query (current user)
- **Authorization check**: Uses `user.uid` instead of `userProfile.id`

### 2. Enhanced Debugging
Added comprehensive logging to track:
- Current user details (Firebase user and userProfile)
- Booking creation data
- Host vs guest query results
- Button visibility logic

### 3. Proper Role Detection
- **Host bookings**: Query `where('userId', '==', currentUserId)`
- **Guest bookings**: Query `where('guestEmail', '==', user.email)`
- **Button logic**: Only show confirm/decline when `booking.isHost === true`

## Expected Behavior

### Scenario: User A books with User B
1. **User A actions**:
   - Creates booking on User B's calendar
   - `userId` = User B's ID (calendar owner)
   - `guestEmail` = User A's email
   - User A sees booking in their "guest" list
   - User A cannot confirm/decline (only User B can)

2. **User B actions**:
   - Sees booking in their "host" list
   - Can confirm/decline the booking
   - Button visibility: `booking.isHost === true`

### Database Structure
```
booking = {
  id: "booking123",
  userId: "userB_id",        // Calendar owner (who can accept/decline)
  guestEmail: "userA@email", // Person who made the booking
  guestName: "User A",
  status: "PENDING",
  // ... other fields
}
```

### Query Logic
```typescript
// For User A (guest)
hostBookings: where('userId', '==', 'userA_id') // Empty - User A owns no bookings
guestBookings: where('guestEmail', '==', 'userA@email') // Contains the booking

// For User B (host)  
hostBookings: where('userId', '==', 'userB_id') // Contains the booking
guestBookings: where('guestEmail', '==', 'userB@email') // Empty if User B didn't book with anyone
```

## Debug Information
The following debug logs are now available in the browser console:

1. **BookingForm Debug**: Shows who's creating the booking and the data structure
2. **BookingHistory Debug**: Shows user details and query results
3. **Button Visibility**: Shows which user can see confirm/decline buttons
4. **Authorization Check**: Shows detailed user ID comparison for security

## Testing Instructions
1. Login as User A
2. Book a meeting with User B's calendar
3. Check console logs for booking creation
4. Login as User B
5. Check BookingHistory - should see the booking with confirm/decline buttons
6. Login back as User A
7. Check BookingHistory - should see the booking WITHOUT confirm/decline buttons

## Files Modified
- `src/components/dashboard/BookingHistory.tsx`
- `src/components/booking/BookingForm.tsx`
- `src/lib/utils.ts` - Added unique username generation
- `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` - Updated to use unique username generation
- `src/scripts/fixUsernames.ts` - Migration script for duplicate usernames
- `src/app/admin/page.tsx` - Admin panel for managing usernames
- `src/app/profile/page.tsx` - New profile page for username management
- `src/components/dashboard/Sidebar.tsx` - Added profile page link
- Added comprehensive debug logging
- Fixed user ID consistency issues
- Enhanced authorization checks

## New Features Added

### 1. Profile Management Page (`/profile`)
- **Username editing**: Users can change their username with real-time validation
- **Uniqueness checking**: Prevents duplicate usernames
- **Booking URL preview**: Shows the updated booking link
- **Account information**: Displays user details and creation date
- **Quick actions**: Links to other settings pages

### 2. Admin Panel (`/admin`)
- **Duplicate detection**: Find users with duplicate usernames
- **Automated fixing**: Rename duplicate usernames with numbered suffixes
- **Detailed reporting**: Shows which users have conflicts

### 3. Enhanced Username System
- **Unique generation**: New usernames are automatically unique
- **Validation**: Proper format checking (lowercase, numbers, hyphens, underscores)
- **Migration support**: Existing duplicates can be fixed

## Usage Instructions

### For Regular Users:
1. Go to **Profile Settings** (link in sidebar)
2. Edit your username in the profile page
3. Copy your unique booking link
4. Share the link with clients

### For Administrators:
1. Visit `/admin` to manage duplicate usernames
2. Click "Check Duplicates" to find conflicts
3. Click "Fix Duplicates" to automatically resolve them
4. Users can then customize their usernames in their profile
